# Coffee-Shop-String-Functions-
Project Description:
This project involves creating and analyzing a SQL database for a coffee shop to manage customer information, product offerings, and order records efficiently. The project includes building a relational database named CoffeeShop with three key tables: Customers, Products, and Orders. Each table is designed with specific attributes and relationships to ensure data integrity and enable comprehensive analysis of the shop’s operations.

Objectives:
Database Creation:

Establish the CoffeeShop database and create tables for storing customers, products, and orders data.
Define primary keys, foreign keys, and use AUTO_INCREMENT for unique identifiers, ensuring data consistency across tables.
Data Population:

Populate the Customers table with sample data representing a typical southern USA customer base.
Add sample entries for Products, including popular southern beverages and food items.
Record orders in the Orders table with sample data covering various dates in 2023, simulating real customer purchase patterns.
Data Analysis:

Perform data analysis using SQL queries to gain insights into customer spending habits, product popularity, and order history.
Key analyses include:
Total Spending per Order: Calculate the total cost for each order by multiplying product prices with quantities ordered.
Customer Lifetime Value: Sum each customer’s total spending to identify high-value customers.
Product Popularity: Determine the most frequently ordered products to support inventory and marketing decisions.
Customer Preferences: Identify each customer’s favorite product based on order frequency.
Yearly Order Summary: List all 2023 orders with customer and product details, organized chronologically.
Example Queries:
Calculate total cost per order.
Determine total spending by each customer.
Count the number of times each product was ordered.
Identify the most popular product per customer.
List all orders from 2023 with customer and product details.
Tools and Technologies:
SQL: Used for database creation, data insertion, and executing analysis queries.
MySQL Workbench / PostgreSQL: Tools for writing and testing SQL code.
Outcomes:
This SQL-based project provides a solid foundation for data analysis within a relational database, covering key SQL functions, including data joins, aggregations, string manipulations, and conditional queries. The project delivers valuable insights into customer behavior and product performance, helping a coffee shop better understand its business and support decision-making for inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement strategies.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to strengthen SQL skills in real-world scenarios, particularly in retail or food service analytics.
