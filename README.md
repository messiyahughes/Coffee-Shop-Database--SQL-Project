Coffee Shop SQL Database Project


Overview

Hey, y’all! Welcome to my Coffee Shop SQL Database project. This project is something I put together to showcase my skills in database management, querying, and data analysis using SQL. As a data analyst in the making, this project simulates a real-world scenario where a coffee shop needs to manage customer orders, products, and analyze spending trends to improve their business.

Project Objectives

This project highlights how a coffee shop can use SQL to:

Manage their Customers, Products, and Orders efficiently.
Track customer behaviors and identify which customers spend the most.
Analyze product performance to determine the top-sellers.
Provide insights to help the business decide which products to promote and stock more frequently.
Database Structure
The database is composed of three key tables:

Customers – Stores customer details like first name, last name, email, and phone number.
Products – Contains product details like the product name and price.
Orders – Holds order details such as customer ID, product ID, quantity, and order date. It also includes relationships to the Customers and Products tables using foreign keys.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This diagram illustrates the relationships between customers, products, and orders.

SQL Queries
Here are some key queries included in this project:

Top Customers by Spending
Query to identify which customers have spent the most money.

Top-Selling Products
Query to determine the most popular products based on the number of orders.

Customer Order History
This query provides a detailed list of all the orders placed by each customer, including total cost and quantity.

Average Spending per Customer
This query calculates the average spending across all customers for the coffee shop.

Business Insights
With the SQL queries I've used, here are some important business insights:

Top-selling products: The Southern Mocha and Pecan Coffee are big hits, meaning the coffee shop can promote these items more or keep higher inventory.
High-spending customers: By identifying the top spenders, the coffee shop can create targeted marketing campaigns or loyalty programs.
Product demand patterns: The shop can stock more of the most-ordered items and adjust pricing based on demand trends.
Case Study
Scenario: The coffee shop wants to increase profitability and customer retention by focusing on promoting top-selling products and rewarding their biggest spenders. I used SQL queries to:

Identify which products bring in the most revenue.
Highlight customers who order frequently or spend the most.
Recommend stocking and promotion strategies to maximize profits.
How to Use
You can run this project on your own machine by following these steps:

Clone this repository.
Import the SQL script into your MySQL database.
Run the provided queries to explore the data and gain insights.
Conclusion
This project helped me demonstrate the power of SQL in analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and overall business trends. It’s just the beginning of what’s possible with data analysis!
