# Coffee Shop SQL Database Project

## Overview  
Hey y’all! Welcome to my Coffee Shop SQL Database project. This project showcases my skills in database management, querying, and data analysis using SQL. It simulates a real-world coffee shop scenario where the business needs to manage customer orders, products, and analyze spending trends to improve operations.

## Project Objectives  
This project demonstrates how SQL can help a coffee shop:  
- Manage Customers, Products, and Orders efficiently.  
- Track customer behaviors to identify high spenders.  
- Analyze product performance to identify top-sellers and guide stocking decisions.

## Database Structure  
The database consists of three main tables:  
- **Customers**: Stores customer details like first name, last name, email, and phone number.  
- **Products**: Contains product names and prices.  
- **Orders**: Holds order details including customer ID, product ID, quantity, and order date, with foreign keys linking to Customers and Products.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
The ERD illustrates the relationships between Customers, Products, and Orders.

## Key SQL Queries  
Here are some key queries included in this project:  
- **Top Customers by Spending**: Identifies which customers have spent the most.  
- **Top-Selling Products**: Determines the most popular products based on order volume.  
- **Customer Order History**: Lists all orders placed by each customer, including total cost and quantity.  
- **Average Spending per Customer**: Calculates average spending across all customers.

## Business Insights  
The SQL queries provide insights such as:  
- **Top-Selling Products**: Southern Mocha and Pecan Coffee are customer favorites, suggesting they should be promoted or kept in higher inventory.  
- **High-Spending Customers**: Identifying top spenders can help the shop target them with personalized offers or loyalty programs.  
- **Product Demand**: Stocking more of the top-ordered items and adjusting pricing based on demand trends will optimize sales.

## Case Study Scenario  
The coffee shop wants to increase profitability and retention by promoting top-selling products and rewarding high spenders. I used SQL queries to:  
- Identify the most profitable products.  
- Highlight frequent and high-spending customers.  
- Recommend stocking and promotion strategies to maximize profits.

## How to Use  
To run this project on your machine:  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Import the SQL script into your MySQL database.  
3. Run the provided queries to explore the data and gain insights.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and business trends. It’s a great start to applying data analysis techniques to real-world scenarios.
